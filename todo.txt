TODO

-- Need a legalMove method that checks if a move is legal according to the rules.
-- Finish getInitialPieces() method in Checkers.java. It should return the initial coordinates for all the pieces.
-- Scoring is unimplemented. We need to find scored earned when a move is made and update the scores.
-- Maybe we should start thinking about the mini-max tree?
-- How are we going to handle the UI? Maybe someone can quickly write it?
